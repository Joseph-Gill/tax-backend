# Django Social Media Backend Template
1.To see and test all endpoints use the postman collection included in /backend.

2.This template is already set up for email sending. All the email related code is in the registration app.
You can easily extract it from there if you only need email sending for other projects.

3.Nginx is included in this template for convenience  but should probably be put in its own repo in a proper deployment.

4.This template uses a custom User model with email as the unique auth field.
